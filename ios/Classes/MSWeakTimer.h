/**
 `MSWeakTimer` behaves similar to an `NSTimer` but doesn't retain the target.
 This timer is implemented using GCD, so you can schedule and unschedule it on arbitrary queues (unlike regular NSTimers!)
 */
@interface MSWeakTimer : NSObject

/**
 * Creates an `MSWeakTimer` object and schedules it to start ticking inmediately.
 * @note It's safe to retain the returned timer by the object that is also the target.
 * or the provided `dispatchQueue`.
 * @param timeInterval how frequently `selector` will be invoked on `target`. If the timer doens't repeat, it will only be invoked once, approximately `timeInterval` seconds from the time you call this method.
 * @param repeats if `YES`, `selector` will be invoked on `target` until the `MSWeakTimer` object is deallocated or until you call `invalidate`. If `NO`, it will only be invoked once.
 * @param dispatchQueue the queue where the delegate method will be dispatched. It can be either a serial or concurrent queue.
 * @see `invalidate`.
