<h1>Ti.mely</h1>

The Ti.mely project provides access to Android and iOS timers.



# NB: This is a fork and a work in progress. 

In order to provide parity to Javascript setTimeout and setInterval, thise methods have been included (for IOS only, so far... Android to follow! )



__See the updated app.js for an example.__

 



-------------





<h2>Before you start</h2>
* These are iOS and Android native modules updated to work with Titanium SDK 7.3.1.GA
* Before using this module you first need to install the package. If you need instructions on how to install a 3rd party module please read this installation guide.

<h2>Download the compiled release</h2>

Download the platform you wish to use:

* [iOS Dist](https://github.com/benbahrenburg/ti.mely/tree/master/iOS/dist)
* [Android Dist] (https://github.com/benbahrenburg/ti.mely/tree/master/Android/dist)

<h2>Building from source?</h2>

If you are building from source you will need to do the following:

Import the project into Xcode:

* Modify the titanium.xcconfig file with the path to your Titanium installation

Import the project into Eclipse:

* Update the .classpath
* Update the build properties

<h2>Setup</h2>

* Download the latest release from the releases folder ( or you can build it yourself )
* Install the ti.mely module. If you need help here is a "How To" [guide](https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Using+a+Module). 
* You can now use the module via the commonJS require method, example shown below.

<h2>Importing the module using require</h2>
<pre><code>
var timerMod = require('ti.mely');
</code></pre>

<h2>Working with the Timer Proxy</h2>
The timer proxy provides access to a native platform interval timer.  A new timer is created when you call the createTimer() factory object.

<b>Example</b>
<pre><code>

	var timer = timerMod.createTimer();

</code></pre>

<h3>start</h3>
The Timer Proxy start method is called to start the timer.  This method takes a dictionary with the following fields.

<b>Parameters</b>

<b>interval</b> : float

The interval in milliseconds for the timer to fire and trigger the EventListener.

<b>debug</b> : Boolean

The debug flat by default is false.  When set to true debug statements will be printed to the console window.

<b>Example</b>
<pre><code>

	var timer = timerMod.createTimer();
	
	timer.start({
		interval:2000,
		debug:true
	});

</code></pre>

<h3>stop</h3>
The stop method turns off the interval timer. It is important to remember that if you have a EventListener added to the module you will need to use the removeEventListener method to remove your listener before all memory can be released. 

<b>Parameters</b>

<b>None</b> 


<b>Example</b>
<pre><code>
	
	timer.stop();

</code></pre>

<h2>Events</h2>

<b>onIntervalChange</b>

This event is called after the interval timer is fired.  The below shows how to add the onIntervalChange.  Please note it is important to remember that if you have a EventListener added to the module you will need to use the removeEventListener method to remove your listener before all memory can be released. 

<b>Example</b>
<pre><code>

	var timer = require('ti.mely').createTimer();
	
	function showUpdate(d){
		var msg = "interval changed - interval set to " + d.interval + " interval count = " + d.intervalCount;
		Ti.API.info(msg);
	}
	
	timer.addEventListener('onIntervalChange',showUpdate);
	
	timer.start({
		interval:6000,
		debug:true
	});

</code></pre>
